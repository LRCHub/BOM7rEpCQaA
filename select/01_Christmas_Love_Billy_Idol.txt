Have a merry Christmas and a happy new year
Give everyone your blessin' and spread the good cheer
The best gift you can give is the gift of love
It's what the whole world needs
It's what we're dreaming of

So light up the fire, walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love

Children wrap your presents, put them underneath the tree
If everybody gives, then everyone receives
I see your pretty face in the Christmas light
Children are excited, 'cause Santa comes tonight

So light up the fire, walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love

Well I see Santa's been here, there's a smile on my face
He's brought all the presents, put them right in their place
He's probably flyin' high across the moon
He'll be at your chimney any time soon

So light up the fire, walk through the snow
Come and stand with me now under the mistletoe

We all need some Christmas love
Gonna get my Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love
That is what I'm thinkin' of
We all need some Christmas love

We all need some Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love

Christmas love, alright
Oh Christmas love, alright

We all need some Christmas love
We all need some Christmas love
