All I want for Christmas is you
You're the gift that's made my dreams all come true -
All I need for Christmas is here
Finding every sweet surprise
Wrapped up in your eyes
Waiting there for me
Underneath the tree

We'll spend the day
Exchanging kisses
Smile and say "What a Christmas this is"

Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells and mistletoe
Or the tinsel's silver glow
You just look at me and oh - Christmas is here

Long before the snowflakes appear
Without bells and mistletoe
Or the tinsel's silver glow
You just look at me and oh - Christmas is here
